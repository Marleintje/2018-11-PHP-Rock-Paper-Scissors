# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a (very) simple single-player game of rock-paper-scissors. It is built with PHP. 

The purpose of this project was not to make a pretty application, but rather to familiarize myself with the following things and actions:

* Installing the LAMP Stack
* Getting familiar with the Apache2 web server and PHP
* Learning the basic syntax of PHP
* Deepening my understanding of the HTTP request-response cycle and knowing where PHP taps into this (i.e. server-side)

This project has not been deployed. In order to run the application in a browser on your local machine, make sure to install a web server (e.g. Apache) and PHP.

In order for the files to be served to a client (like a browser), the files should be placed in a folder within the root directory as specified by the configuration file of the web server. Note that the default port of the web server is specified in the ports configuration file.
